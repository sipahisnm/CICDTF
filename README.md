## Automating Terraform with CI/CD

In this DevOps project, you will dive deep into the world of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) by setting up a Terraform pipeline using GitLab CI/CD to automate infrastructure deployment on AWS. Blue-Green deployment, a powerful DevOps strategy, will be a central focus, enabling you to release new software with minimal downtime and risk.

Throughout this project, you will gain hands-on experience with Terraform, a leading infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool, and learn how to integrate it seamlessly into a CI/CD pipeline on AWS. You'll also explore best practices widely used in the industry, from writing efficient Terraform code to managing infrastructure lifecycle with version control.

This is an ideal opportunity to enhance your DevOps skills by working on a real-world Terraform project, leveraging GitLab CI/CD to automate your deployment processes, and mastering the principles of blue-green deployment in a cloud environment.
